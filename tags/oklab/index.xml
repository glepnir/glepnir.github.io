HSL values until it &amp;ldquo;feels right,&amp;rdquo; use it for a few weeks, then get that
creeping eye strain. Suddenly colors that looked fine before would start to
irritate me. Back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must have done this dozens of times. Each round felt more arbitrary than the
last—just moving sliders around hoping something would click. Honestly, it was
getting ridiculous. Why couldn&amp;rsquo;t I just find something that worked and stick
